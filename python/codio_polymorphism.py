'''
Notes:
Polymorphism - single interface is applicable with different types (i.e. + operator)
-> method overriding is a form
Method Overloading - single method name that can take different sets of parameters
-> also example of polymorphism
-> when two methods have same name, python recognizes the last method (ignores rest)
-> declare method with optional parameters set to None
-> ex: print(int.__mul__(num1, num2)) for *, (int.__truediv__(num1, num2))
Operator overloading - __operation__ (dunder/magic methods)
-> applies to all inssnes suitibility by what it does, not by type
-> ex: The print_hit function does not care if the object is has the type BaseballPlayer 
or Song. It only cares if the object has a hit method. Duck typing is an example of polymorphism 
because, in this case, a single function works with objects of different types.
-> define function (i.e. print_function) taking obj as parameter and executing wanted method
-> check for existence of method (try except AttributeError)

# The Substitute class reads a text file and replaces every fifth word with the string HELLO.
# Create the class Stars which is a child class of Substitute. Then override the swap_words method so that every third word is replaced by a series of *. If the word has three letters then it should be replaced with ***. The number of * should match the number of characters in the word. Write the new string to self.answer_file.
# Important
# Keep the following things in mind as you write your code. Changes should only be made to the Stars class; do not alter the code for the file variables and the Substitute class.
# The source_file attribute represents the file you will read.
# The answer_file attribute represents the file to which you will write your new text.
# The string_to_list method converts the string (the text file) into a 2D list. Each inner list represents a sentence. The elements of each inner list are the words that make up that sentence.
# The list_to_string method converts the 2D list back into a string.
# When you override the swap_words methods, be sure to start with string_to_list and use list_to_string before writing to the file.
# The text used for this activity are the first four sentences of Jane Austenâ€™s Pride and Prejudice.
