Notes:
Polymorphism - single interface is applicable with different types (i.e. + operator)
-> method overriding is a form
Overloading - single method name that can take different sets of parameters
-> also example of polymorphism
-> when two methods have same name, python recognizes the last method (ignores rest)
-> declare method with optional parameters set to None
-> ex: print(int.__mul__(num1, num2)) for *, (int.__truediv__(num1, num2))
